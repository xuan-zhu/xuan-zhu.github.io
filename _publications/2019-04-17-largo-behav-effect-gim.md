**Abstract:**<br>
**_Purpose:_** This study examined whether participants who learned research results related to a germline <i>CDKN2A</i> variant known to be associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma would pursue confirmatory testing and cancer screening, share the genetic information with healthcare providers and family, and change risk perceptions.<br>
**_Methods:_** Participants were pancreas research registry enrollees whose biological sample was tested in a research laboratory for the variant. In total, 133 individuals were invited to learn a genetic research result and participate in a study about the disclosure process. Perceived cancer risk, screening intentions, and behaviors were assessed pre-disclosure, immediately post-disclosure, and 6-months post-disclosure.<br>
**_Results:_** Eighty individuals agreed to participate and 63 completed the study. Immediately post-disclosure, carriers reported greater intentions to undergo pancreatic cancer and melanoma screening (p-values≤.024). Seventy-three percent of carriers (47.5% non-carriers) intended to seek confirmatory testing within six months and 20% (2.5% non-carriers) followed through. All participants shared result with ≥1 family member. More carriers shared result with their healthcare provider than non-carriers (p=.028).<br>
**_Conclusions:_** Recipients of cancer genetic research results may not follow through with recommended behaviors (confirmatory testing, screening), despite stated intentions. The research result disclosure motivated follow-up behaviors among carriers more than non-carriers.
