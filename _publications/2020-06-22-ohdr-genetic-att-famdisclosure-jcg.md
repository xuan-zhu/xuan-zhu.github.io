**Abstract:**<br>
The lack of data on perspectives of racial and ethnic minority populations regarding family disclosure of individual research
results (IRR) hinders the development of return of IRR policies and practices that are meaningful and culturally appropriate in
diverse populations. This research aims to uncover preferences regarding family disclosure of IRR and identify factors that may
shape the preferences in three minority populations. Nine focus groups with 68 adult African American, Hispanic/Latinx, and
American Indian/Alaska Native individuals were conducted. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Participants were
willing to share IRR with relatives who elected to know and preferred a participant-driven (vs. researcher-driven) decisionmaking
process. Privacy of personal information was deemed important, as were anticipated familial benefits from genetic
information, except when improper use of the information was suspected. Factors influencing family disclosure decisions
included the family’s biological and emotional closeness, and participants’ perceived mental preparedness of the relative.
Family disclosure of IRR among racial and ethnic minority individuals is a complex decision-making process wherein issues
of individual privacy are entangled with family dynamic and familial benefit considerations. These data suggest that policies
surrounding family disclosure of IRR should carefully consider participant preferences and adopt a participant-driven approach.
