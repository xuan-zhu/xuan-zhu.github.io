Hi there! I’m Xuan Zhu (Pronunciation: "Shwan Zoo"), a Senior Health Services Analyst in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/about" target="_blank">Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a> at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. I'm a social and behavioral scientist by training with an interdisciplinary background at the intersection of communication science, public health, and social psychology. My research focuses on behavior change related to health, with long-standing interest in the development, implementation, and evaluation of behavior theory-informed strategic communication and behavior change interventions to improve disease prevention and control in disadvantaged populations. Additionally, since joining Mayo Clinic, I developed a keen interest in applying behavior theories to understand the “why” and “how” of clinician behavior change in relation to the implementation of evidence-based practice innovations. I utilize quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods approaches to address varied research questions. 

I received a PhD in Mass Communication with a focus on Health Communication and a Doctoral Minor in Public Health, from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I completed a post-doctoral fellowship in Health Care Policy and Research in the Department of Health Sciences Research at Mayo Clinic. 

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, baking, drawing, painting, and sewing.
