Hi there! I’m Xuan Zhu, a postdoctoral research fellow under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/radecki-breitkopf-carmen-ph-d/bio-00055044" target="_blank"> Carmen Radecki Breitkopf, PhD</a> in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-health-sciences-research/overview" target="_blank">Department of Health Sciences Research</a> at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. I’m a social and behavioral scientist by training with a background in mass communication. I study health communication phenomena through the lens of social psychology. My long-standing research interest has been in examining how strategically designed persuasive health communication can improve health promotion, disease prevention, and quality of health care among vulnerable populations. I am motivated to pursue an academic, translational-research career. 

Specifically, my current research interests include 1) delineating mechanisms underlying health information processing and finding strategies to alleviate resistance to health risk information and strategies to instill resistance to health misinformation, 2) improving patient health outcomes through removing barriers to high quality patient-centered communication and optimizing patient education, and 3) delineating mechanisms underlying genetic testing decision-making and finding strategies to return genetic research results that maximizes cascade genetic testing uptake. My topical areas of interest include cancer risk reduction, women’s health, chronic pain, and return of genetic research results.

I approach research questions from an interdisciplinary perspective that draws upon theoretical developments in communication, psychology, and public health. I use an array of social scientific methods to answer my research questions, including experiments, surveys, focus groups, and in-depth interviews.

I received a PhD in mass communication from the <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/hsjmc" target="_blank">Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication</a> at the University of Minnesota and a Graduate Minor in public health from the <a href="http://www.sph.umn.edu/" target="_blank">School of Public Health</a>, a MS in advertising from the <a href="https://media.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">College of Media</a> at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a BA in advertising from <a href="http://en.xisu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Xi’an International Studies University</a>.

In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, painting, and sewing.
