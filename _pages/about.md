Hi there! I’m Xuan Zhu, a postdoctoral research fellow in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-health-sciences-research/overview" target="_blank">Department of Health Sciences Research</a> at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. I’m a social and behavioral scientist by training with a background in mass communication. I study health communication phenomena through the lens of social psychology. 

My long-standing research interest has been in examining how strategically designed persuasive health communication can improve health promotion, disease prevention, and quality of health care among vulnerable populations. I am motivated to pursue an academic, translational-research career. I am currently interested in developing a research program in women’s health focusing on improving women’s health outcomes through removing barriers to high quality patient-centered communication and optimizing patient education.

I received a PhD in mass communication from the <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/hsjmc" target="_blank">Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication</a> at the University of Minnesota and a graduate minor in public health from the <a href="http://www.sph.umn.edu/" target="_blank">School of Public Health</a>, a MS in advertising from the <a href="https://media.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">College of Media</a> at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and a BA in advertising from <a href="http://en.xisu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Xi’an International Studies University</a>.
